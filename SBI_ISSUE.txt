Dear sir/Madam,

I hope this letter finds you in good health. My name is Karthiban G, and I am writing to express my deep concern and frustration regarding the handling of my home loan accounts ([38789008987 & SURAKSHA 38794445900]) with State Bank of India (SBI). I have been a loyal customer of SBI for four years and have always valued the relationship I have had with your esteemed bank. However, recent events have left me deeply disappointed and frustrated.

In August 2021, I opted for the restructuring of my home loan account, following the advice of the bank officials. During this process, specific commitments were made, particularly regarding the treatment of overdue amounts and the eligibility criteria for applying for restructuring. The commitment made was that if my account experienced any overdue amount, it would be added to the principal, and only after regularizing the account could I apply for restructuring.

To my dismay, following the completion of the restructuring period, I discovered that my account had been classified as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA) without any prior notification from the bank. This revelation came to light only when I applied for a personal loan with another institution, and my credit report reflected the NPA status of my home loan.

Upon visiting the branch in May 2023, the manager informed me that it was an error from the bank's side, and the issue would be rectified promptly. The bank provided a No Objection Certificate (NOC) document. However, after a gap of five months, the bank demanded a payment of INR 81,669 and altered the EMI (33600 Rs) without any prior communication.

I have been diligently repaying the EMIs as per the automated deduction system set up by the bank after the restructuring. However, the bank's failure to communicate effectively and its inconsistencies in honoring commitments have adversely affected my credit score. I applied for a personal loan elsewhere, unaware of the NPA status, based on the commitments made by another bank.

I am distressed by the lack of transparency and communication in this matter. I feel unfairly burdened by the consequences of the bank's oversight, which is impacting my financial standing and creditworthiness. I have attempted to convey my concerns to the local branch and have sent emails to the chairman, but regrettably, my pleas have fallen on deaf ears.

I am left with no choice but to escalate the matter further. This letter serves as a formal legal notice to bring to your attention the serious issues I am facing due to the negligence and breach of commitment by SBI. I believe in the principles of fairness and customer service that your esteemed bank upholds and trust that a satisfactory resolution can be reached.

I kindly request a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the classification of my account as an NPA and the subsequent demand for payment without proper communication. I am open to providing any necessary documentation or information to facilitate a prompt resolution. I also urge you to consider the impact this situation has had on my personal well-being and the stress it has caused me.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and kindly request that you keep me informed of the progress. If necessary, I am prepared to escalate this matter to Legal action need to against the bank.

Sincerely,

Karthiban
